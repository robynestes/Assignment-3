		<h1>A Guide to Foraging Local Mushrooms</h1>
	</header>
	<div class="container">
		<p>Mushroom foraging is a fun and easy way to get out and explore nature, as well as appreciate what the earth has to offer. Did you know there are over 5,000 different species of mushrooms in Ontario, many of which are edible? Three of the most common mushrooms to forage for in the forests of Ontario are oyster mushrooms, golden chanterelles, and black trumpets. In this guide I will teach you what to look for when hunting for these lovely mushrooms, and tips on where to find them and how to safely remove them and bring them home.<br> 

<br>When picking mushrooms, be careful to remove them properly. Using two fingers or a pocket knife to gently pluck them from the earth and cut them at the stem is recommended, as well as having some paper bags or Ziploc bags ready to store them for the journey home. Be careful where you collect them as well! In Ontario it is often forbidden to forage in provincial parks and public parks, so it’s best to stick to Crown land or private land.<br>

<br>Last but certainly not least, when in doubt, throw it out. Unless you’re absolutely positive you can identify the mushroom you’ve chosen, it’s always safer to leave it. Some mushrooms can cause damage to you or even be fatal when ingested.</p>

          <h2><b>Black Trumpets</b></h2>
					<p>are fairly easy to identify from their pronounced black vase or trumpet-like shape and dark colour. Similar to chanterelles, they also have a “gilled” underside which can help to identify them. These mushrooms can most often be found on the forest floor in moss or leaf debris, so be careful not to step on them! Unlike the other two mushrooms in this list, their taste is a little more unique and has been described as having a smoky and earthy taste.</p>

          <h2><b>Golden Chanterelles</b></h2>
					<p>are one of the most commonly foraged mushrooms in Ontario, and can be identified by their golden colour, “gilled” texture and wavy or upturned shape. These mushrooms are known to be an expensive delicacy, and can have a fruity or nutty flavour. One of the reasons they are so expensive is that they need very specific growing conditions, so it is recommended to look for them near trees such as pines, Douglas firs and Hemlock spruces. </p>

          <h2><b>Oyster Mushrooms </b></h2>
					<p>can most often be found on dead hardwood trunks or logs lying on the ground, and can be identified by their large flat white cap and “gills” underneath. A good clue for identifying them is that it is most common to see them grouped together. Do not pick them if they have a fuzzy brown texture anywhere on them, as this could be their poisonous lookalike, the velvet roll-rim. Oyster mushrooms have a delicate nutty taste when cooked, and are great stir-fried or sauteed in many dishes!</p>
